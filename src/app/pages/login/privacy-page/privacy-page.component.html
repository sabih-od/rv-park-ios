      KJ RV Portal takes precautions to protect your information. When you submit
      sensitive information via the website, your

      sensitive information (e.g. credit card information), that

      billing or customer service) are granted access to
      personally identifiable information. The computers and servers in which we
      store personally identifiable information are kept in
      a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss, misuse,
      unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the
      user's personal information under our control.

      The Company also uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) for authentication and
      private communications to build users' trust and
